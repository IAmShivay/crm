# CRM System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Lead API 500 Error
**Problem**: The leads API was returning 500 errors when fetching leads.
**Root Cause**: Issues with RTK Query response structure handling and potential database connection problems.
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive debug logging to leads API
- Fixed RTK Query response structure expectations
- Updated components to handle correct API response format

### 2. Lead Update API 500 Error  
**Problem**: Lead update API was failing with 500 errors.
**Root Cause**: Validation issues and missing error handling.
**Solution**:
- Added detailed debug logging throughout the update process
- Enhanced error handling with stack traces in development
- Added proper validation for statusId, tagIds, and assignedTo fields
- Added Activity logging for lead updates

### 3. RoleManager Component Error
**Problem**: `roles.map is not a function` error in RoleManager component.
**Root Cause**: RTK Query was expecting `Role[]` but API returns `{ success: boolean; roles: Role[] }`.
**Solution**:
- Updated RTK Query type definition for getRoles
- Fixed component to access `rolesData?.roles` instead of `rolesData`

### 4. TagManager Component Issues
**Problem**: TagManager was using old fetch-based API calls instead of RTK Query.
**Solution**:
- Converted TagManager to use RTK Query hooks
- Updated create and delete handlers to use mutations
- Removed old fetch-based code

### 5. Mock Data in Recent Activity
**Problem**: Recent Activity component was showing mock data as fallback.
**Solution**:
- Removed all mock activity data
- Updated component to show empty state when no real activities exist
- Added proper loading state handling

### 6. Missing Sign-in/Sign-out Activity Logging
**Problem**: User sign-in and sign-out events were not being logged in recent activity.
**Solution**:
- Added Activity logging to signIn function in auth.ts
- Created new logout API endpoint at `/api/auth/logout`
- Added sign-in/sign-out activity types to RecentActivity component
- Added proper icons and colors for auth activities

## New Features Added

### 1. Comprehensive Activity Logging
- **Lead Creation**: Logs when leads are created with metadata
- **Lead Updates**: Logs when leads are updated with changed fields
- **User Sign-in**: Logs when users sign in to workspaces
- **User Sign-out**: Logs when users sign out from workspaces

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added detailed debug logging to all critical APIs
- Enhanced error responses with stack traces in development
- Better error messages for validation failures

### 3. New Logout Endpoint
- Created `/api/auth/logout` endpoint
- Logs sign-out activity across all user workspaces
- Proper authentication verification

## API Endpoints Updated

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Enhanced with activity logging
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - **NEW** - Handles sign-out with activity logging

### Leads
- `GET /api/leads` - Fixed 500 errors, added debug logging
- `POST /api/leads` - Added activity logging for lead creation
- `PUT /api/leads/[id]` - Fixed 500 errors, added activity logging

### Activities
- `GET /api/activities` - Returns real activity data (no more mock data)

## Component Updates

### RecentActivity
- Removed all mock data
- Added support for sign-in/sign-out activities
- Enhanced activity type handling
- Proper empty state display

### RoleManager
- Fixed RTK Query response handling
- Updated to use correct data structure

### TagManager  
- Converted from fetch to RTK Query
- Updated CRUD operations to use mutations
- Removed old fetch-based code

## Database Schema Updates

### Activity Collection
New activity types added:
- `user_signed_in` - When user signs in
- `user_signed_out` - When user signs out  
- `lead_created` - When lead is created
- `lead_updated` - When lead is updated

## Security Enhancements

### Lead Updates
- Enhanced validation for statusId, tagIds, and assignedTo
- Workspace-scoped validation to prevent cross-workspace data access
- Proper ObjectId format validation

### Activity Logging
- All activities are workspace-scoped
- User authentication required for all activity logging
- Graceful failure handling (activities don't break main operations)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Lead Operations**:
   - Create new leads and verify activity logging
   - Update leads and check activity entries
   - Verify proper error handling

2. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Sign in and verify activity is logged
   - Sign out using new endpoint and verify activity
   - Check activities appear in Recent Activity component

3. **Test Component Functionality**:
   - Verify RoleManager loads and displays roles correctly
   - Test TagManager CRUD operations
   - Confirm Recent Activity shows real data only

## Configuration Notes

- All debug logging is enabled in development mode
- Activity logging failures don't break main operations
- Enhanced error responses include stack traces in development only

## Next Steps

1. Monitor server logs for any remaining issues
2. Test all CRUD operations thoroughly
3. Verify activity logging is working correctly
4. Consider adding more activity types as needed
5. Update API documentation with new endpoints
